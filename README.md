# MNIST
Problem: MNIST is a well known dataset consisting of 60K images of handwritten numbers 0-9. It is a classical dataset to get started with Deep Learning algorithms. 
Description: In this project, I have explored the dataset and tried to understand the dataset through visualisation. And built an fully connected NN and a CNN based model and trained them individually and compared and contrasted their performance based on accuracy scores. 
Skills Demonstrated: Data Visualisation, CNN, ANN, Model building, training and evaluation.
